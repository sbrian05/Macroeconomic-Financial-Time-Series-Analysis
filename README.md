# Time Series Forecasting & Cointegration Analysis in R
This project applies time series econometric methods to real-world economic and financial data. It is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Inflation Forecasting Model
Analysis of U.S. inflation data (CPI).

Built AR(1), AR(2), and AR(p) models to forecast inflation.

Conducted stationarity tests (ADF), autocorrelation analysis, and QLR test for structural breaks.

Evaluated forecast performance using pseudo out-of-sample forecasts and RMSFE.

Part 2: Stock Market Cointegration & VECM
Analyzed monthly returns of Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).

Tested for cointegration using the Engle-Granger method.

Built a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to forecast stock returns.

Measured model accuracy using RMSFE.

Tools
R (base functions and allowed packages only)

Manual implementation for econometric tests and model evaluation.

Project Goal
To develop hands-on experience in time series analysis, forecasting economic indicators, and modeling financial market relationships for practical forecasting and investment insights.
